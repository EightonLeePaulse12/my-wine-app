## Project Overview

Provide a brief introduction to your project. What does it do? Why did you build it?

This is quite a simple project and there are not any hectic things in this project. What makes it interesting is that I will be using a framework that is entirely new to me, Next.js. This project will be a project in which users can manage their wine collections to keep track of them. I will also be using Prisma ORM, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL and a number of other dependencies that I will install to make this project worth while and to make everything I'll be learning worthwhile as well.

## Features

I plan to add quite the number of features. If I do not end up adding all of these features, it must be because of the limited amount of time I have to build this as well as the fact that I am only now learning, So I might get stuck on certain things. Features below are listed as:

- Crud: Create, Read, Update and Delete entries to keep track of your wine collection
- Login and Register: Be able to log into your account as well as register yourself if you have not yet.
- Dark mode as well as light mode. This will be fun to try with Tailwind CSS.
- Changing passwords (I have added this in a previous Vue.js project and would like to try and implement it in this Next.js project).
- Adding profile pictures
- Full management over your own account, which includes updating your username, email and password (I have also used this in a previous project).
- Search, sort and filter your wine.
- Insert images feature (I have never tried this but it will be great to see how far I will get with it).
- Front page that generates random images from other users that also use the app, it will be kind of a recommendation feature.
